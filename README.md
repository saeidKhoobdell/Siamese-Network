# Siamese Network with PyTorch

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **Siamese Network** using PyTorch. The included notebook (`siames_network_pytorch.ipynb`) provides a step-by-step approach to building and training a Siamese Network for similarity detection between images.

## **Theory Behind Siamese Networks**

### **What is a Siamese Network?**
A Siamese Network is a type of neural network architecture designed to learn the similarity between pairs of inputs. Unlike traditional classification networks, a Siamese Network takes two inputs and outputs a similarity score. This makes it ideal for tasks where relationships between inputs matter, such as:

- Facial verification
- Signature matching
- Duplicate detection
- Image similarity

### **How Does It Work?**
1. **Shared Weights**:
   - The Siamese Network consists of two identical subnetworks that share the same weights and architecture.
   - Each subnetwork processes one input independently, generating an embedding (a feature representation).

2. **Comparison of Embeddings**:
   - The embeddings from both subnetworks are compared using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
   - The network is trained to minimize the distance for similar pairs and maximize it for dissimilar pairs.

3. **Loss Function**:
   - The **contrastive loss** is commonly used to train Siamese Networks:
     \[
L = (1 - Y) \cdot \frac{1}{2} D^2 + Y \cdot \frac{1}{2} \max(0, m - D)^2
\]

     Where:
     - \(Y\): 1 for similar pairs, 0 for dissimilar pairs.
     - \(D\): Distance between embeddings.
     - \(m\): Margin that separates dissimilar pairs.

## **Siamese Network Architecture**

The implemented architecture contains two parts:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
   - Extracts features from input images.
   - Layers include:
     - Convolutional layers with `ReflectionPad2d` for better edge preservation.
     - ReLU activations.
     - Batch normalization.

2. **Fully Connected Network (FC):**
   - Processes the flattened features and generates embeddings.
   - Outputs a vector representation of the input.

## **Applications of Siamese Networks**

- **Facial Recognition**: Comparing two faces to determine if they belong to the same person.
- **Signature Verification**: Authenticating handwritten signatures.
- **Document Matching**: Checking similarity between documents or images.
- **Object Tracking**: Identifying the same object across different frames in a video.

## **Visualization of Results**

During training, pairs of images are compared, and their similarity scores are computed. The notebook visualizes example pairs along with their predicted similarity values.
